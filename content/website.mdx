In software engineering CI/CD, continuous integration and continuous delivery, connects each aspect of the software's life.

<CICD />

CI/CD allows me to change this website, ensure it works properly, and remain confident that the software is operating properly. While developing this *serverless* website, I decided to implement CI/CD because software development should be easy and I need a blog that is easy to manage.

# Code

I've used many text editors, but I tend to just use the one that's the most supported. I'd argue that today, VS Code has the largest community backing.

<Vscode />

I use this step to write the Javascript and Python needed to produce the webpages and request the data from the backend.

# Build

After writing the Javascript, the website is built using Gatsby. Gatsby is a great choice for static websites because it is fast and has great search engine optimization, SEO.

<Gatsby />

Gatsby optimizes and converts all of the Javascript into static HTML and Javascript that runs on the browser. This is really great because it ensures that the content is fast and responsive. The issue I have with Gatsby is the time it takes to build all of the HTML and Javascript is over 10 minutes.

# Test

Testing is *required*. It makes development much easier and faster. I use both Javascript and Python to serve the REST API. [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) is a great tool for testing the python package and functions I use, while [Jest](https://jestjs.io) is great for testing the Javascript package and functions I use.

<Pytest /><Jest />

[Cypress](https://www.cypress.io) is used to ensure all the different portions of code work together. Cypress automates webpages appearing in the browser and tests to see if the website continues to operate the same way.

<Cypress />

# Release

After proving that the code functions properly, I update the code on my public GitHub [repository](https://github.com/tnorlund/Blog).

<Github />

This allows me to have a place where I can save the progress I've made, and even allows me to revert changes. GitHub offers many apps and services that integrate with your repository. I use GitHub Actions and Gatsby Cloud.

<GithubActions /><GatsbyCloud />

With GitHub Actions, software developers can automate their workflow by doing something every time they update their work stored in a repository. Gatsby Cloud builds the static HTML and Javascript the browser requires. Since Gatsby Cloud is owned by the Gatsby team, the service is optimized such that builds with Gatsby Cloud take a fraction of the time other services require. These integrations allow me to modify and integrate changes easily. 

# Deploy

Everything needs to be deployed to Amazon Web Service.

<Aws />

Amazon Web Service offers many *services* to *serve* you content at a global scale. *Service*.

[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io) is a service that treats the AWS services as code.

<Terraform />

Since I can treat the infrastructure as code, I can code both the frontend and backend while managing both in GitHub Repositories.

The backend repository is organized such that there are 3 modules: [Content Delivery](#content-delivery), [API](#api), and [Login](#login).

## Content Delivery

The static content is stored in an S3 bucket that is then distributed by Amazon CloudFront. This *Content Delivery Network* distributes the static content across the globe, ensuring that you get it as fast as possible.

CloudFront got realtime logging at the last AWS re:Invent conference in 2020. This allows for Amazon Kinesis to process the realtime logs in *realtime*. I can then access the logs using SQL queries through Amazon Athena.
<ContentDelivery />

## API

The content that changes is managed by Amazon API Gateway. The API is a secure way to transact data from Amazon DynamoDB.

## Login

Finally, the content can be protected through Amazon Cognito. This service sets the permissions for the user.

# Operate

With GitHub Actions managing the release and deployments in this CICD pipeline, it made the most sense to operate the services used through GitHub Actions as well.

After talking to the folks at Gatsby Cloud, I learned of an *undocumented* GraphQL API for setting variables in `ENV`, allowing for the two repositories to operate succinctly. 

<Graphql />

I wrote a script for handling this and wrapped it in a GitHub Action. You can read about it [here](/blog/releasing-a-github-action).

# Monitor

Amazon CloudWatch is a great service that allows me to monitor the different Amazon services I use through custom dashboards.

<CloudWatch />

There is a huge room for improvement with realtime logging. I'm looking forward to building a more sufficient way to monitor.

# Plan

On GitHub, anyone can file an issue and update the website through a pull request. This allows me to easily plan and update anything and ensure that it remains operational and works as I plan it to.
