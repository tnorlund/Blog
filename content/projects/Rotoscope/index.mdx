In Fall of 2016, I took the Digital Image Processing course at University of the Pacific. In this course I learned of many image processing techniques. At the end of the course, [Iain Murphy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/iain-murphy-00a428106/) and I decided to combine the techniques learned throughout the course to create a rotoscoping algorithm. We attempted to copy a Charles Schwab [commercial](https://youtu.be/1AGSVHuYdXA) that had animators spend weeks rotoscoping over the video of an investor sharing their story.
