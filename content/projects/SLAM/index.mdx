description: "A system of cameras that measures real-world geometry."

This is a project where I learned different approaches to the simultaneous localization and mapping, SLAM, problem. This problems uses different camera perspectives in order to reconstruct real-world geometry. I ended up following [Cyril Stachnis](http://www.ipb.uni-bonn.de) and reached out to him through LinkedIn. After learning the different algorithms, I decided to develop my own camera system for SLAM!
