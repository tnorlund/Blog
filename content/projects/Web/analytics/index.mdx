AWS offers fast, scalable compute with Lambda functions. Previously, I talked about how these functions can control access to a database through an API. I decided to ad another database and API to manage the analytics of this website.

Amazon Kinesis Firehose allows for gigabytes of data to be stored. This raw data is stored in an S3 bucket as '.parquet' files for every minute the website is up and running.
