description: "What I think makes a good programmer."
---

I've had my [github](https://github.com/tnorlund) for 3 years now.

I've been programming longer, but I know I could always become a better programmer. The best programmers I know all have side projects and open source repositories. Why not me? 

This website is now open source under the MIT license. Please check out the [repository](https://github.com/tnorlund/Blog) and let me know what you think.

The README has the steps required to reproduce bot the front-end and back-end. Give it a shot, and let me know what you think.
