While developing the [analytics](/website) used for this blog, I started using Python again. I exclusively used Python for a while, but now I'm using most JS. 

The open source nature of JS pushes its developers to use some really good practices. These "best practices" produce code that is continuously integrated and deployed. After touching Python again, I thought I'd use some of these practices.

# Linting

I needed a linter in order to maintain consistent, readable code. [Pylint](https://pylint.org) was the best linter I found while doing my research.

<Pylint />

Similar to [ESLint](https://eslint.org), Pylint allows for a `.pylintrc` file to customize the errors and conventions that are important to you. I was also able to integrate a Github action that lints the entire repository after every push. Sadly, an [issue](https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/issues/3836) is stopping me from showing the results right now.

# Unit Testing

So my first job was integrating unit tests for a company that leveraged test-driven development. Unit tests are *boring*, but they prevent regression. In grad school, I briefly touched [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/).

<Pytest />

I'm still currently writing the tests; I'm currently only at 15% test coverage. Using Lambda layers and Lambda containers will force me to use some form of regression testing.
