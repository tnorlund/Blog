I recently purchased [Kent C. Dodd's](https://twitter.com/kentcdodds?s=21) course on [testing javascript](https://testingjavascript.com). Testing code is necessary because it
- ensures your product works
- sets a standard of how the product performs
- it saves time... *in the long run*

I started using what I learned in this course by implementing testing strategies with this blog. The course mentions the 4 steps in testing:
1. [Static Tests](#static-tests)
2. [Unit Tests](#unit-tests)
3. [Integrations Tests](#integrations-tests)
4. [End To End Tests](#end-to-end-tests)

## Static Tests
Static tests allow the software to be tested before executing the code. While programming Javascript, I use [ESlint](https://eslint.org) and the [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) [extension](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-eslint).

<Eslint />

<Vscode />

## Unit Tests
After testing the code itself, unit testing allow individual units of code to be tested for use. [Jest](https://jestjs.io) is a unit testing library for javascript that allows me to test how sets of code work by themselves.

<Jest />

## Integration Tests
After proving that the units of code work together, the units can be combined and tested in integration testing. These tests take longer but increase your confidence in the product. I use [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io) to test how the [React](https://reactjs.org) components work together.

I was also able to test a node package's integration with Amazon's proprietary [DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) by using a [Docker](https://www.docker.com) container of DynamoDB.

## End To End Tests
Now I am a huge fan of [GitHub](https://github.com/tnorlund/Blog) and use it daily. Github offers [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) where you can integrate scripts you create with the actions you make on Github.

The actions allow me to run the Jest and Cypress tests in my repositories easily.

## Conclusion

There's still a lot of work to do. I'm going to start learning [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io) to create integration tests that work with the same services that the code uses in production.
