I've been using Illustrator for a while, and thought that it'd make sense to make sense of the pen tool.

The pen tool is used to set 'anchor points' and manipulate their 'handles' if the anchor point is set to the curve type. This is a simplified explanation of a Bézier curve.

# Why?

If a graphic can be described as a linear equation, it can save tremendous amounts of time to describe it. The World Wide Web Consortium, [WWWc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web_Consortium), has developed a web standard, [SVG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics), where modern day browsers can render graphics extremely efficiently.

<W3C />

<SVG />

Your browser interprets the rendered HTML, JavaScript and CSS as a window with a `viewPort`. An SVG describes its size in the DOM as 4 numbers. It is known as the `viewBox`.

```xml
<svg 
  viewBox="0, 0, 200pt, 200pt"
/>
```

SVG's graphics are fairly standard. There's `circle`, `ellipse`, `line` and `polyline`, but I'm more interested in `path`. This allows you to set *Bézier* and *elliptical* curves. These curves are encoded with specific letters and numbers used to determine how the `path` moves in the `viewBox`.  

```xml
<svg 
  viewBox="0, 0, 200pt, 200pt"
>
  <path d= "..."/>
</svg>
```

# The Secret 
The majority of shapes can be drawn with *Bézier* and *elliptical* curves. They both *interpolate* between their endpoints. 

## Bézier

These equation-described graphics are expressed with 'control points', $\mathbf{P}$. Each control point, $\mathbf{P}_{n}$, is unique in it's attributes. The different control points determine the line, $\mathbf{B}$, with respect to time, $t$, such that, $0 \le t \le 1$.

### Linear Bézier Curve

The Bézier curve is straight when the control points are colinear.

$$
\mathbf {B} (t)=\mathbf {P} _{0}+t(\mathbf {P} _{1}-\mathbf {P} _{0})=(1-t)\mathbf {P} _{0}+t\mathbf {P} _{1}\,,\,0\leq t\leq 1
$$

This line is interpolated *linearly*, meaning that it moves the same distance with respect to $t$.

### Quadratic Bézier Curve

The quadratic Bézier curve is the path traced with $\mathbf{P}_{0}$, $\mathbf{P}_{1}$, and $\mathbf{P}_{2}$.

$$
\mathbf {B} (t)=(1-t)[(1-t)\mathbf {P} _{0}+t\mathbf {P} _{1}]+t[(1-t)\mathbf {P} _{1}+t\mathbf {P} _{2}]\, ,\, 0\leq t\leq 1
$$

This equation can be interpreted linearly:

$$
\mathbf {B} (t)=(1-t)^{2}\mathbf {P} _{0}+2(1-t)t\mathbf {P} _{1}+t^{2}\mathbf {P} _{2}\,,\,0\leq t\leq 1.
$$

The intermediate points on $\overline{\mathbf{P_{0}P_{1}}}$ and $\overline{\mathbf{P_{1}P_{2}}}$ create a line. This line creates the Quadratic Bézier Curve, $B$, when linearly interpolated.

### Cubic Bézier Curve

$$
\mathbf {B} (t)=(1-t)^{3}\mathbf {P} _{0}+3(1-t)^{2}t\mathbf {P} _{1}+3(1-t)t^{2}\mathbf {P} _{2}+t^{3}\mathbf {P} _{3}\, , \,0\leq t\leq 1.
$$
