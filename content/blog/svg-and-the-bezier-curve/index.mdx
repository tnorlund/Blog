I've been using Illustrator for a while, and thought that it'd make sense to make sense of the pen tool.

The pen tool is used to set 'anchor points' and manipulate their 'handles' if the anchor point is set to the curve type. This is a simplified explanation of a Bézier curve.

# Why?

If a graphic can be described as a linear equation, it can save tremendous amounts of time to describe it. The World Wide Web Consortium, [WWWc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web_Consortium), has developed a web standard, [SVG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics), where modern day browsers can render graphics extremely efficiently.

<W3C />

<SVG />

SVG is an Extensible Markup Language where standard way of processing its data is dependent on a predetermined set of shapes. These shapes are describes by the paths that surround them. The paths are describes in a certain `viewBox`. It's 4 numbers that determine where to render the 'view' into the `viewPort`. The `viewPort` is the visible area of the webpage. These numbers can be described in `pt` or and other measurement the browser supports. 

```xml
<svg 
  viewBox="0, 0, 200pt, 200pt"
/>
```

These shapes are fairly standard. There's `circle`, `ellipse`, `line` and `polyline`, but I'm more interested in `path`. This allows you to set *Bézier* and *elliptical* curves. These curves are encoded with specific letters to determine how the `path` moves in the `viewBox`.  

```xml
<svg 
  viewBox="0, 0, 200pt, 200pt"
>
  <path d= "..."/>
</svg>
```

# The Secret 
The majority of shapes can be drawn with *Bézier* and *elliptical* curves. They both *interpolate* between their endpoints. 

## Bézier

These equation-described graphics are expressed with 'control points', $\mathbf{P}$. Each control point, $\mathbf{P}_{n}$, is unique in it's attributes. The different control points determine the line, $\mathbf{B}$, with respect to time, $t$, with respect to a range from 1 to 0, $0 \le t \le 1$.

### Linear Bézier Curve

The Bézier curve is straight when the control points are colinear.

$$
\mathbf {B} (t)=\mathbf {P} _{0}+t(\mathbf {P} _{1}-\mathbf {P} _{0})=(1-t)\mathbf {P} _{0}+t\mathbf {P} _{1}\,,\,0\leq t\leq 1
$$


### Quadratic Bézier Curve

The quadratic Bézier curve can be linearly *interpolated* using 'control points' $\mathbf{P}_{0}$, $\mathbf{P}_{1}$, and $\mathbf{P}_{2}$.

$$
\mathbf {B} (t)=(1-t)[(1-t)\mathbf {P} _{0}+t\mathbf {P} _{1}]+t[(1-t)\mathbf {P} _{1}+t\mathbf {P} _{2}]\, ,\, 0\leq t\leq 1
$$

It is constructed by intermediate points $\mathbf {Q_{0}}$ and $\mathbf {Q_{1}}$, such that the intermediate points and 'control points' are described by $t$ to draw the line $\mathbf {B}$

<QuadraticBezier />

$$
\mathbf {B} (t)=(1-t)^{3}\mathbf {P} _{0}+3(1-t)^{2}t\mathbf {P} _{1}+3(1-t)t^{2}\mathbf {P} _{2}+t^{3}\mathbf {P} _{3}\, , \,0\leq t\leq 1.
$$
