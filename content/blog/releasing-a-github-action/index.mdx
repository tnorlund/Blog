import GithubActions from 'components/Icons/GithubActions'
import GatsbyCloud from 'components/Icons/GatsbyCloud'
import Graphql from 'components/Icons/GraphQL'

After implementing a [CICD](/website) workflow on this site, I've learned how effective automation can be in software development.

I decided to take this a step further by writing my own GitHub Action.

<GithubActions />

I reached out the Gatsby Cloud team to ask if there was a way to use an API to change the `ENV` of a Gatsby site built with Gatsby Cloud.

<GatsbyCloud />

After reaching out to Gatsby's support team, I was shown an *unsupported* GraphQL API used to change the `ENV`.

<Graphql />

They showed me the query and mutation used to request and change the `ENV` respectively.

```
mutation UpdateAllEnvironmentVariablesForSite(
  $id: UUID!
  $buildEnvironmentVariables: [TagInput!]!
  $previewEnvironmentVariables: [TagInput!]!
) {
  updateBuildEnvironmentVariablesForSite: updateEnvironmentVariablesForSite(
    id: $id
    environmentVariables: $buildEnvironmentVariables
    runnerType: BUILDS
  ) {
    success
    message
  }
  updatePreviewEnvironmentVariablesForSite: updateEnvironmentVariablesForSite(
    id: $id
    environmentVariables: $previewEnvironmentVariables
    runnerType: PREVIEW
  ) {
    success
    message
  }
}
```

I wrapped this mutation along with the query in my own [GitHub Action](https://github.com/tnorlund/gatsby-cloud-action). It's really easy to add to a GitHub Action workflow:

```yml {numberLines}
name: Test and Terraform

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  Unit-Tests:
# ...
  - name: Terraform Apply # L132
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' && github.event_name == 'push'
    run: |
      cd terraform
      terraform apply -auto-approve
      terraform output --json &> output.json

  - name: Gatsby Cloud Sync
    uses: tnorlund/gatsby-cloud-action@v1.1.2
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' && github.event_name == 'push'
    with:
      gatsby-token: ${{ secrets.GATSBY_TOKEN }}
      gatsby-site-id: ${{ secrets.GATSBY_SITE_ID }}
      terraform-output: terraform/output.json
```

The above example updates this site every 'push' to the master branch.

This allows me to make a quick change, `terraform plan` to view the expected changes, and update the Gatsby site with the new services used.
