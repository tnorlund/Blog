So JavaScript is pretty good. Not really...

JavaScript is used by a [lot of people](https://2020.stateofjs.com/en-US/). While being as old as me, JavaScript has been supported by many, and will most likely not go away anytime soon. 

JavaScript executes in the browser and relies heavily on just-in-time compilation. This means that the browser translates the static code downloaded into something it can execute. JavaScript's compilation is "just-in-time," due to the fact that it translates this code right after downloading it. This leaves room for bugs, malicious execution of code, and a whole lot more.

While being the most used language today, JavaScript has no type definitions and requires the developer to implicitly understand how different parts of the program interact with one another. This is where the superset of JavaScript, TypeScript, shines.

<Typescript/>

TypeScript allows for statically-typed objects. This allows developers to understand how the different portions of the program work together. With a firm understanding of what goes where, TypeScript will *hopefully* replace JavaScript and speed up development.

I'm currently translating my JavaScript to TypeScript, and have found it extremely easy. Because TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, I can rename all my JavaScript '.js' file to TypeScript '.ts' files and call it a day.

Hopefully you can understand my sarcasm. TypeScript is a great tool and requires you to approach programming completely differently than JavaScript. My translation will take some time, but it is always worth it in the long run.
