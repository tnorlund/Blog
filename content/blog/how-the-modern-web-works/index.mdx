I spent a lot of time today trying to render a component through SSR, server-side rendering. I'm ending today defeated because the current version of ReactDOM does not support React's `<Suspense>` tag.

Now, this is a bummer, but it forced me to take a step back and understand what everything is doing. I'd like to think of this as the building blocks of the modern web. How do all these tools reduce a complex project into *only* HTML, JavaScript, and CSS?

## Module Bundler

Module bundlers take all of the JavaScript code the developer writes and "minifies" it to a single JavaScript file. This is the code the developer writes and the dependencies he or she uses to expedite their development. The most common module bundler is [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org).

Now webpack is a great tool, but the modern ES6 the developer writes cannot be run in the browser. This is where the transpiler comes in.

## Transpile

Classes, fat arrow functions, and much more give JavaScript syntactic sugar, making the development process easier to read, write, and express.

You can write everything in the JavaScript the browser interprets, but this is 2021. Nobody got time for that. [Babel](https://babeljs.io) converts this 'edge' JavaScript into plain ES6, allowing it to run in any browser.

## Conclusion

The modern web is rendered on the server and client. Both use static JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to render functional, scalable pages. The problem I had today was that I was rendering "client" JavaScript on the "server," skipping both Babel and Webpack.

The modern web is always changing, but it will always require JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The question stands: what tools will developers continue to use to serve this static code?
