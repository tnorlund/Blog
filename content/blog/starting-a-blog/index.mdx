All the successful people I follow share a lot of content. [Garry Vaynerchuk](https://twitter.com/garyvee?s=21), [Joe Rogan](https://twitter.com/joerogan?s=21), and [Elon Musk](https://twitter.com/elonmusk?s=21) all have presence online. I know that I can develop a successful brand to influence the world by creating content.

This blog will help me:
- develop confidence in what I have to say
- help me with my writing skills
- gain insight in what others are interested in
- grow an identifiable brand

Moving forward, I will share what I find interesting and what I want others to know about me.
