So I just downloaded the iPad version of Adobe Illustrator and I love it. After watching a few of Adobe's tutorials, I took a stab at recreating Illustrator's icon.

This allowed me to get comfortable with the pen tool. Now, the pen tool *is* scary, but using it with the Apple Pencil is awesome. Moving anchor points effortless makes the pen tool *less* scary. 

The iPad version doesn't have the luxury of a keyboard. This version leverages a special "touch shortcut." This button is used to change the tool you're currently using. Whether it's aligning, scaling, or rotating shapes, this little button seems like a great implementation of keyboard shortcuts on a touch screen.

With this version releasing less than a day ago, I understand that there's room for improvement. I've already experienced a few bugs of certain shapes appearing on different layers, but I'm excited to see how this changes my workflow. Hopefully, we'll get VS Code on the iPad. One can only hope.
