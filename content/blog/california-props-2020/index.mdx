So today I finally started reading the voter information guide for the 2020 election. Most of it is pretty boring, but there are a few propositions that are pretty dramatic.

# Proposition 15
> *Increases Funding Sources for Public Schools, Community Colleges, and Local Government Services by
Changing Tax Assessment of Commercial and Industrial Property.*

So the first time I heard of Proposition 15 was a commercial through YouTube. Who doesn't want to make sure the schools are funded?

While most of the advertisements I've seen regarding Proposition 15 have talked about schools, none have mentioned *real estate*. California is responsible for many laws protecting property owners from taxes, and Proposition 15 is no different. Well, actually it is. 

Proposition 15 is also known as "Split Roll." If Proposition 15 passes, it will be the biggest change to California's tax system in my generation. Currently, property taxes in California are based on the original purchase price of both homes and commercial properties. Proposition 15 will split the tax roll of homes and commercial properties.

Increased taxes will change how landlords deal with their tenants. Although small businesses and farmers are exempt from Proposition 15, landlords will pass the costs off to their tenants. I will vote **NO** on Proposition 15.

# Proposition 16
> *Allows Diversity as a Factor in Public Employment, Education, and Contracting Decisions.*

California removed affirmative action a while ago. Some are saying that Proposition 16 will bring it back, but in my opinion, I don't think Proposition 16 is the answer.

Other perspectives regarding any situation is *always* helpful. Would Proposition 16 actually increase diversity? I really don't think so. My biggest problem with Proposition 16 is that the consideration of race, gender, and ethnicity is dependent on what the individual *identifies* as. A company's board members could easily "identify" as whatever race, gender, or ethnicity they chose. This Proposition comes with good intent, but it is loosely worded and wouldn't change much. I plan on voting **NO** on Proposition 16.

# Proposition 22
> *Exempts App-Based Transportation and Delivery Companies From Providing Employee Benefits to Certain Drivers.*

This is a doozy! Both R's and D's are supposedly for Proposition 22. This is the proposition I've seen the most advertising for. The advertisements are all *pro* Proposition 22, but what's the catch? 

To better understand the situation, you've got to at least acknowledge last year's [AB 5](https://edd.ca.gov/Payroll_Taxes/ab-5.htm). This bill was supposed to reclassify many of contract workers as employees. This caused Uber and Lift to [threaten to leave](https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelgoldstein/2020/08/19/will-lyft-and-uber-bolt-california-over-states-anti-independent-contractor-law/#21e4302e103a) California. 

It seems that Proposition 22 would rewrite AB 5 for these "gig companies." With Lyft, Uber, and Doordash contributing more that $100 million, it's easy to see that stakes are high for these tech giants. I honestly do see them leaving the lucrative land of California. I plan on voting **NO** on Proposition 22.

# Proposition 24
> *Amends Consumer Privacy Laws.*

Californis is responsible for the first data privacy law in the US. This allowed you to ask businesses for all the information they have about you and ask them not to sell it. But Alastair Mactaggart, the guy responsible for this law two years ago, is saying that this was not strong enough.

Proposition 24 further limits the use of data businesses have by limiting the time the business can hold your data. This also adds a new agency to enforce privacy law. I plan on voting **YES** on Proposition 24.

# Conclusion

*I do not know that much about politics.*

These few Propositions are the only ones I'm interested in. The others range from stem-cell research to bail. This doesn't mean that I will not vote for the other Propositions. I'm just saying here that I don't know enough about them yet. I will continue to read more into them, but currently, I have 15, 16, 22, and 24 have my attention.
