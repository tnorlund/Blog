[Previously](/blog/typescript), I talked about how I'd like to convert the JavaScript I use in this blog to TypeScript. I finally did it!

Going into it, I only knew what other people told me: TypeScript takes a lot of work. They weren't wrong, but my previous effort of documenting through JSDoc helped incredibly. Here are some of the things that I learned while converting the code.

# Strict Type Checking

I have a function that calculates the scroll offset of each header for the table of contents. 

```js
const accumulateOffsetTop = ( el, totalOffset = 0 ) => {
  while ( el ) {
    totalOffset += el.offsetTop - el.scrollTop + el.clientTop
    el = el.offsetParent
  }
  return totalOffset
}
```

TypeScript requires the parameter types given to `accumulateOffsetTop`. This ensures that the parameters are not modified within this scope.

```ts
const accumulateOffsetTop = ( 
  el: HTMLElement, totalOffset = 0 
) : number => {
  let current : unknown = el
  while ( current instanceof HTMLElement ) {
    totalOffset += el.offsetTop - el.scrollTop + el.clientTop
    current = current.offsetParent
  }
  return totalOffset
}
```
